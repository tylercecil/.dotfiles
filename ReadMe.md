### Development Environment

I want to set up a more useful development environment for myself.
Unfortunately, I get so unfocused working on this, so I am going to write out a wishlist,
to keep myself focused on one thing at a time.

Most of my problems are with editors feeling like they don't really work / or I
don't really know how to use them.

- Editor
    - Enumerate what I want from an editor
        - LSP
        - Treesitter?
        - Server
        - Code analysis
        - Whatever I'm using, learn to use it!
    - Can I run Kakoune? What stops me today?
- Terminal
    - Open file at line / with selection
    - RG hyperlinks?
    - RG and fzf
    - Open shell at location
- Tree Viewer
- WM
    - Aerospace keystrokes that don't bug me.
        - I COULD map *real* control to a super key of some kind? Would that
        suck? Or Cmd-Alt? Or DOUBLETAP Cmd? I just need to put some real thought
        into it. And deside if it's really blocking my text editor woes.
- QOL
    - Middle Click
